# Actblue-Donations-Scrape
Uses websockets to gather bundle donations to actblue as well as seeing the total amount they raised

legitimately made this in 10 minutes after RBG died and actblue got millions in donations so I wanted to see

future things to add
1. track amount of donations since 1 minute, since 30 seconds, since 1 hour, etc / database?? (no idea ngl)
2. store information
3. figure out cpm
4. host on website
maybe add winred
